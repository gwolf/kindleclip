Description: User interface for managing Amazon Kindle's "My Clippings" file
 Amazon Kindle devices store a "My Clippings.txt" file, where the
 bookmarks, highlights and notes are kept. This application allows you
 to search within the clippings, filter the contents, and copy and
 paste to other applications.
 .
 This program is in no way endorsed, promoted or should be associated
 with Amazon. It is not –and does not aim to be– an official Kindle
 project.
